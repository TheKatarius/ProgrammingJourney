<!-- Detailed Guidelines and Structure

    Form Initialization:
        Start by defining the <form> element. This will be the container for all your form inputs and sections.
        Within this form, you will create multiple sections, each delineated by a <fieldset> element.

    Section 1 - Personal Information:
        Use the first <fieldset> to gather personal details.
        Include a <legend> that reads "Personal Information" or something similarly descriptive.
        Within this section, add input fields for name, email, and phone number. Each field should be accompanied by a <label>.
        The input fields should have appropriate type attributes (like text, email, tel).

    Section 2 - Course Preferences:
        In the second <fieldset>, focus on course-specific preferences.
        The <legend> for this section could be "Course Preferences".
        Include options to select course topics (use <select> and <option>), preferred session times (could be checkboxes), and any special accommodations needed.

    Section 3 - Payment Details:
        The third <fieldset> is for payment information.
        Label it with a <legend> saying "Payment Details".
        This section should include fields for credit card information, billing address, and any promo codes. Ensure to use the correct input types for security, like type="password" for sensitive information.

    Complexity and Cognitive Challenge:
        To make this task more challenging, integrate a mix of input types (text, radio buttons, checkboxes, date pickers) throughout the form.
        Additionally, add a small JavaScript functionality that dynamically updates a part of the form based on user input (like showing/hiding a section based on a checkbox).
        Include an "Other" option in relevant sections, which when selected, reveals an additional input field for the user to provide custom information.

    Final Touches:
        Conclude the form with a submit button.
        Add a small section with a link to the terms and conditions and a checkbox for the user to acknowledge them. -->

Link label to input:

    The for attribute in each <label> should match the id of the corresponding <input>. This enhances accessibility by ensuring that clicking the label focuses the associated input.
    Example: <label for="name">Name:</label> <input type="text" id="name">

Form Action Attribute:

    The action attribute of the <form> is empty. While this might be intentional for a mock-up, in a real scenario, it should point to a server-side script that processes the form data.

Buttons created with the BUTTON element function just like buttons created with the INPUT element, but they offer richer rendering possibilities: the BUTTON element may have content. For example, a BUTTON element that contains an image functions like and may resemble an INPUT element whose type is set to "image", but the BUTTON element type allows content.

Just FYI you don't have to use type="submit" with button, as the default for type is submit.
