<!-- Detailed Instructions

    Incorporating a Semantic Header:
        Create a <header> element at the top of your page.
        The header should encapsulate elements like the site title or logo and potentially a brief introduction or tagline.
        This is the face of your webpage; it should clearly indicate what your site or page is about.

    Intuitive Navigation with <nav>:
        Craft a <nav> element, typically placed within your <header> or right below it.
        Populate it with at least four hyperlinks (<a> tags). These links could be dummy links (href="#") but should represent typical sections of a website like Home, About Us, Services, Contact.
        Focus on making your navigation intuitive and user-friendly.

    Main Content Area with <main> and <article>:
        Use a <main> element to define the central content of your webpage.
        Within <main>, insert at least two <article> elements. Each article should represent an independent, self-contained portion of content - imagine them as blog posts or news articles.
        Every <article> should have its own <header> and <footer>. The header could include a title (using <h1> to <h6>) and maybe a date or author name, while the footer might contain tags or share buttons.

    Supplementary Content with <aside>:
        Next to your main content, add an <aside> section.
        The content here should be related but not essential to the main content. Think of things like author bios, related links, advertisements, or a sidebar with additional navigation links.

    Concluding with a <footer>:
        Design a <footer> for your page.
        It should include information like copyright notices, contact information, or links to privacy policies and terms of service. -->

<!--
    _blank - new tab, _self(default) - same tab, _parent, _top - same tab in this case
    Hyperlink should always have

    Hyperlinks:
        Title Attribute:
    Although optional, adding a title attribute can provide additional context, especially when the link text is not self-explanatory.
    Example: <a href="https://www.example.com" title="Discover our range of web development services">Our Services</a>.

        Target Attribute for External Links:

    Use target="_blank" to open external links in a new tab or window, but this should be used judiciously as it can take control away from the user.
    Example: <a href="https://www.externalwebsite.com" target="_blank">Visit External Website</a>.

        Rel Attribute for External Links:

    When using target="_blank", also include rel="noopener noreferrer" for security and performance reasons.
    Example: <a href="https://www.externalwebsite.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visit External Website</a>.

        Using Mailto for Email Addresses:

    For email links, use mailto: followed by the email address.
    Example: <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Email Us</a>.

Linking to a Downloadable File:

    If linking to a file (like a PDF), inform the user that clicking the link will download a file.
    Example: <a href="path/to/file.pdf" download>Download Our Brochure (PDF)</a>.
