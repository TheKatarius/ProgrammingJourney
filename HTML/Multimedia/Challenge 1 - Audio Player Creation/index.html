<!--
    use controls attribute to display the audio on page
    Attribute Experimentation:

    autoplay: Makes the audio start automatically upon page load. However, remember that modern browsers might restrict this to prevent unsolicited audio play.
    loop: This creates an endless loop of the audio track. It's a test of seamless playback.
    muted: Starts the audio in a muted state. It's particularly intriguing to combine this with autoplay.

    we can add many extensions of the same audio when the browser does not support one of those, it is good practice to add type attribute then
    good practice - create separated folder for audio files in a project
    good practice - add error string within audio element under the sources(for better look), when the audio is not supported
    when there is no audio with specific path, then the controller changes its color to grey
