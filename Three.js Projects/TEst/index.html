				In the mystical realm of HTML, where trees are tags and leaves are
				elements, I bring web pages to life. Through the artistry of CSS, I
				paint dreamy screens akin to the Northern Lights. Armed with a
				JavaScript wand and a TypeScript grimoire, I summon interactive magic.
				Trained by the React Wizards, I'm adept in the craft of components and
				hooks.
